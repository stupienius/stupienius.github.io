  "To define a human from a philosophical perspective is to go beyond mere biology and examine the qualities that distinguish humans as conscious and reflective beings. Humans are not only living organisms but also self-aware entities capable of thought, introspection, and deliberate action. Aristotle famously described humans as rational animals, emphasizing that reason allows us to navigate not only the physical world but also the ethical and social dimensions of life. This rationality is intertwined with our capacity for moral judgment: humans can discern between right and wrong, make choices guided by ethical principles, and reflect on the consequences of their actions. Yet, existentialist thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre remind us that human existence is not predetermined; rather, we are beings defined by freedom, compelled to create our essence through choices, commitments, and projects. This freedom carries with it profound responsibility, as each decision contributes to the ongoing construction of the self. From a phenomenological perspective, humans are also defined by their lived experience—their conscious perception of the world, the meanings they assign to events, and their engagement with others. A human, therefore, is a being who inhabits both the objective reality of nature and the subjective realm of thought and emotion. We seek purpose, cultivate relationships, and grapple with questions of value, mortality, and identity. In this sense, humanity is not a fixed category but a dynamic process: humans are ever in the act of becoming, of interpreting, and of striving toward understanding. To be human is to dwell in the tension between the known and the unknown, the finite and the infinite, the individual and the collective—a creature of reflection, choice, and imagination, continually shaping both self and world.",
